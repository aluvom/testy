        // --- QUIZ DATA ---
        const quizData = [
            // Module A
            { question: "Which of the following best describes the primary objective of the 'Make in India' initiative when viewed through the lens of structural economic transformation?", options: ["To achieve full employment in the urban sector.", "To increase the manufacturing sector's share in GDP to 25% and create jobs.", "To reduce India's reliance on agricultural exports.", "To exclusively promote large-scale industries over MSMEs."], answer: 1, explanation: "The stated goal of 'Make in India' is to transform India into a global manufacturing hub, aiming to increase the sector's contribution to GDP to 25% and create 100 million new jobs by 2022 (later revised)." },
            { question: "The 'demographic dividend' is often cited as a major advantage for India. However, this dividend can turn into a 'demographic disaster' if which of the following conditions is not met?", options: ["A sustained increase in the population growth rate.", "Adequate investment in health, education, and skill development to create a productive workforce.", "A shift in population from urban to rural areas.", "Strict government controls on labor migration."], answer: 1, explanation: "The dividend is the potential economic benefit from a large working-age population. This potential can only be realized if the workforce is skilled, educated, and healthy enough to be employable and productive." },
            { question: "The concept of 'jobless growth' in the Indian context primarily refers to a situation where:", options: ["GDP growth is negative, leading to job losses.", "The economy is growing, but the rate of employment generation is not keeping pace with the number of new entrants into the labor force.", "The unemployment rate is zero, but underemployment is high.", "All economic growth is concentrated in the agricultural sector."], answer: 1, explanation: "This term captures the paradox where economic output increases due to productivity gains (e.g., from technology and automation) without a corresponding increase in employment opportunities." },
            { question: "The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index measuring average achievement in three key dimensions. What are these three dimensions?", options: ["GDP per capita, Infant Mortality Rate, and Gross Enrolment Ratio.", "Poverty Index, Inflation Rate, and Foreign Exchange Reserves.", "A long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.", "Industrial output, Agricultural output, and Services sector growth."], answer: 2, explanation: "HDI is based on three pillars: life expectancy at birth (long and healthy life), mean & expected years of schooling (knowledge), and Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (a decent standard of living)." },
            { question: "Which of the following is NOT a primary objective of NITI Aayog?", options: ["To foster cooperative federalism.", "To act as a think tank for the government.", "To allocate financial resources to states based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.", "To design strategic and long-term policy and programme frameworks."], answer: 2, explanation: "Financial allocation to states is a function of the Finance Commission. NITI Aayog is a think tank that focuses on policy formulation and cooperative federalism, not financial allocation." },
            { question: "Consider the impact of the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Which of the following represents a potential second-order negative externality for the Indian economy, despite the scheme's primary goal of boosting domestic manufacturing?", options: ["A surge in imports of raw materials, temporarily worsening the Current Account Deficit (CAD).", "Creation of monopolistic or oligopolistic market structures in targeted sectors, stifling long-term innovation.", "A significant shift of the labor force from the agricultural sector to the manufacturing sector, causing a food security crisis.", "An immediate and sharp appreciation of the Indian Rupee due to increased FDI inflows."], answer: 1, explanation: "While (A) is a possible short-term effect, the more significant long-term risk is that providing incentives to a few large players can reduce competition, leading to higher prices and less incentive for innovation once the subsidies end." },
            { question: "A key debate around India's economic development model involves the 'middle-income trap,' where a country's growth plateaus after reaching a certain income level. Which of the following policy combinations presents the most robust strategy for India to avoid this trap?", options: ["Focusing exclusively on export-oriented manufacturing and maintaining low labor costs.", "Implementing aggressive fiscal consolidation and reducing public expenditure on social infrastructure.", "Prioritizing investment in human capital, fostering a culture of innovation through R&D, and improving institutional quality.", "Strengthening the agricultural sector through higher MSPs and providing universal basic income to boost consumption."], answer: 2, explanation: "Avoiding the middle-income trap requires a shift from resource-driven growth to innovation-driven growth. This is only possible through high-quality human capital, a strong R&D ecosystem, and efficient institutions." },
            { question: "The concept of 'K-shaped recovery' was widely discussed post-pandemic. In the context of the Indian economy, what does this primarily signify?", options: ["A recovery where the quarterly GDP growth rates fluctuate in the shape of the letter 'K'.", "A situation where different sectors of the economy recover at vastly different rates, leading to widening inequality.", "A recovery driven equally by both the manufacturing and services sectors.", "A recovery model where Keynesian principles are applied first, followed by a shift to supply-side economics."], answer: 1, explanation: "A K-shaped recovery describes a divergent path where some parts of the economy (e.g., large corporations, IT sector) grow rapidly, while others (e.g., small businesses, informal sector) stagnate or decline." },
            { question: "Which of the following best describes the structural challenge associated with India's high score on the 'Informal Economy' parameter in global indices?", options: ["It leads to lower tax-to-GDP ratio and limits the fiscal capacity of the government.", "It results in higher-than-average national savings rates.", "It promotes entrepreneurship at the grassroots level.", "It reduces the effectiveness of international trade agreements."], answer: 0, explanation: "The informal sector largely operates outside the tax net, which severely constrains the government's ability to collect revenue and fund public services, a key limitation for an emerging economy." },
            { question: "The 'NITI Aayog' was established to replace the Planning Commission. Which fundamental shift in governance philosophy does this transition represent?", options: ["A shift from a command-and-control approach to a 'cooperative federalism' and 'nudge' approach.", "A move from indicative planning to imperative planning.", "A focus on centralized resource allocation over state-led development.", "An emphasis on five-year plans over long-term strategic vision documents."], answer: 0, explanation: "The Planning Commission used a top-down, centralized model. NITI Aayog is designed as a think tank that promotes cooperative federalism by working with states and uses 'nudge' principles to guide policy." },
            { question: "What is the primary characteristic of a 'sunrise sector' in an economy?", options: ["A sector that is old and has reached market saturation.", "A sector that is new, growing rapidly, and expected to be important in the future.", "A sector that is heavily dependent on government subsidies to survive.", "A sector that operates only during daylight hours, like solar power generation."], answer: 1, explanation: "A sunrise sector is characterized by rapid growth, high potential, and significant future prospects, often driven by new technology or changing consumer preferences." },
            { question: "In the context of globalization, which statement best explains the impact of trade liberalization on an emerging economy like India?", options: ["It guarantees an improvement in the current account balance.", "It exposes domestic industries to foreign competition, which can drive efficiency but may also harm nascent industries.", "It automatically leads to a reduction in income inequality.", "It primarily benefits the agricultural sector over the industrial sector."], answer: 1, explanation: "Trade liberalization increases competition. This can force domestic firms to become more efficient but can also overwhelm smaller, less-developed domestic industries before they have a chance to grow." },
            { question: "The term 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' emphasizes self-reliance. From an economic policy perspective, this is best interpreted as:", options: ["An isolationist policy aimed at cutting off all imports.", "A strategy to build domestic capacity and resilience to become a more significant part of the global economy.", "A policy focused solely on reviving traditional industries.", "A short-term measure to control inflation."], answer: 1, explanation: "'Atmanirbhar Bharat' is not about economic isolation but about strengthening India's domestic capabilities (supply chains, manufacturing, etc.) so it can engage with the global economy from a position of strength." },
            { question: "What does the 'Gini Coefficient' measure?", options: ["The rate of inflation in an economy.", "The level of industrial diversification.", "The degree of income or wealth inequality within a population.", "The total output of an economy."], answer: 2, explanation: "The Gini Coefficient measures the distribution of income or wealth. A value of 0 represents perfect equality, while a value of 1 represents perfect inequality." },
            { question: "What is meant by the 'Formalization of the Economy'?", options: ["Increasing the number of government jobs.", "Bringing more businesses and workers into the tax net and providing them with social security benefits.", "A mandate for all business communication to be in a formal language.", "Shifting economic activity from the services sector to the manufacturing sector."], answer: 1, explanation: "Formalization involves moving economic activities from the informal sector (unregistered, untaxed, no social security) to the formal sector, improving tax compliance and worker welfare." },
            { question: "Which of the following is a key feature of Priority Sector Lending (PSL) norms in India?", options: ["They are voluntary guidelines for banks to follow.", "They mandate that banks lend a certain percentage of their credit to specific sectors like agriculture and MSMEs.", "They apply only to public sector banks.", "They require banks to lend at a zero percent interest rate to these sectors."], answer: 1, explanation: "PSL norms are mandatory RBI regulations that require banks to allocate a specific fraction of their total lending (Adjusted Net Bank Credit) to sectors deemed important for national development." },
            { question: "The economic reforms of 1991 are often described by the acronym 'LPG'. What does 'LPG' stand for?", options: ["Labour, Production, Growth.", "Liberalization, Privatization, Globalization.", "Land, Power, Government.", "Liquidity, Profitability, Governance."], answer: 1, explanation: "The 1991 reforms were centered on Liberalization (reducing government control), Privatization (transferring ownership of public assets), and Globalization (integrating the Indian economy with the world economy)." },
            { question: "What is the primary role of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the Indian economy?", options: ["They are the largest contributors to foreign exchange reserves.", "They are major employers, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, and foster entrepreneurship.", "They are the primary source of government tax revenue.", "They are mainly involved in capital-intensive industries."], answer: 1, explanation: "SMEs are the backbone of the Indian economy in terms of job creation, contributing significantly to employment, second only to agriculture." },
            { question: "Which of the following best defines 'sustainable development'?", options: ["Maximizing GDP growth in the short term, irrespective of the environmental impact.", "Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.", "A development model that relies exclusively on renewable energy sources.", "Economic growth that is funded entirely by domestic savings."], answer: 1, explanation: "This is the classic Brundtland Commission definition of sustainable development, emphasizing inter-generational equity." },
            { question: "A 'special economic zone' (SEZ) is an area in which:", options: ["Only agricultural activities are permitted.", "The business and trade laws are different from the rest of the country to attract investment and boost exports.", "No taxes are levied on any economic activity.", "Only public sector undertakings are allowed to operate."], answer: 1, explanation: "SEZs are designed to be engines of export growth by offering a more liberal legal and tax regime than the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA)." },
            { question: "The 'twin deficit problem' for an economy refers to:", options: ["Deficit in the agricultural and industrial sectors.", "High unemployment and high inflation.", "The simultaneous occurrence of a fiscal deficit and a current account deficit.", "A deficit in tax revenue from both direct and indirect taxes."], answer: 2, explanation: "A fiscal deficit (government spending > revenue) can lead to a current account deficit (imports > exports) if the excess government spending spills over into demand for imported goods." },
            { question: "What is the most significant challenge associated with the agricultural sector in India?", options: ["Lack of a market for agricultural products.", "Over-production of all crops leading to price crashes.", "High dependence on monsoons, fragmented landholdings, and low productivity.", "Complete absence of government support or subsidies."], answer: 2, explanation: "These are the core, long-standing structural issues of Indian agriculture: dependence on unpredictable monsoons, small and uneconomical farm sizes, and lower yields compared to global averages." },
            { question: "From a policy perspective, a government's decision to disinvest its stake in a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) is an example of:", options: ["Nationalization.", "Privatization.", "Monetization.", "Socialization."], answer: 1, explanation: "Disinvestment is the process of the government selling its stake in a PSU to private entities, which is a form of privatization." },
            { question: "What is the core idea behind the 'One Nation, One Tax' slogan for the Goods and Services Tax (GST)?", options: ["To have only a single tax rate for all goods and services.", "To create a unified national market by subsuming multiple central and state taxes.", "To collect tax only from one person in each household.", "To replace income tax with a consumption tax."], answer: 1, explanation: "The primary goal of GST was to replace a complex web of multiple indirect taxes levied by central and state governments with a single, comprehensive tax, creating a unified market." },
            { question: "An increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is generally considered more stable and beneficial for an economy than an increase in Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) because:", options: ["FDI is easier to liquidate and withdraw.", "FDI represents a long-term interest in the economy, often involving the transfer of technology and management skills.", "FPI is not taxed, whereas FDI is.", "FDI can only be invested in the stock market."], answer: 1, explanation: "FDI involves a long-term commitment and is harder to pull out quickly during a crisis. It often brings capital, technology, and expertise, contributing to the productive capacity of the economy. FPI is more liquid and often termed 'hot money'." },
            // Module B
            { question: "If the RBI sells government securities in the open market under its Open Market Operations (OMO), what is the most likely immediate effect on the banking system?", options: ["It increases the liquidity in the system, leading to lower interest rates.", "It absorbs liquidity from the system, leading to higher interest rates.", "It has no impact on liquidity but increases the profitability of banks.", "It directly increases the fiscal deficit of the government."], answer: 1, explanation: "When the RBI sells government securities, it takes money from the banks that buy them. This reduces the cash reserves (liquidity) in the banking system, making inter-bank borrowing more expensive and pushing interest rates up." },
            { question: "The concept of 'velocity of money' refers to:", options: ["The speed at which a bank can print new currency notes.", "The rate at which money changes hands within an economy in a given period.", "The interest rate charged by the central bank.", "The speed at which foreign exchange rates fluctuate."], answer: 1, explanation: "Velocity of money (V) is a measure of how many times one unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a given time period. It is a key variable in the quantity theory of money (MV = PQ)." },
            { question: "According to the Keynesian theory of economics, what is the most appropriate government response during an economic recession?", options: ["Decrease government spending and increase taxes to balance the budget.", "Increase government spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand.", "Maintain a constant level of government spending and taxes.", "Focus exclusively on monetary policy by reducing interest rates."], answer: 1, explanation: "Keynesian economics advocates for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. During a recession (low demand), the government should increase spending and/or cut taxes to inject demand into the economy." },
            { question: "If the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) is 4.5% and the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is 18%, what does this imply for a scheduled commercial bank?", options: ["The bank must lend at least 22.5% of its deposits to the government.", "The bank must hold a minimum of 22.5% of its Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) in highly liquid assets.", "The bank can lend out a maximum of 77.5% of its NDTL.", "The bank's profitability is guaranteed to be at least 22.5%."], answer: 1, explanation: "CRR (4.5%) is the portion of NDTL to be kept as cash with the RBI. SLR (18%) is the portion to be invested in approved liquid assets (like G-Secs). Together, they represent the total minimum liquid assets a bank must hold (22.5%)." },
            { question: "'Inflationary gap' occurs when:", options: ["Actual aggregate demand is less than the aggregate demand required to achieve full employment.", "Actual aggregate demand is greater than the aggregate demand required to achieve full employment, leading to price rises.", "The government's budget deficit is rising.", "The import bill is higher than the export earnings."], answer: 1, explanation: "An inflationary gap exists when the actual aggregate demand exceeds the potential output of the economy at full employment, causing 'too much money chasing too few goods,' which leads to inflation." },
            { question: "If the RBI wants to make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers to stimulate economic activity, which of the following actions would it most likely take?", options: ["Increase the Repo rate.", "Decrease the Repo rate.", "Increase the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR).", "Sell government bonds in the open market."], answer: 1, explanation: "The Repo rate is the rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks. A decrease in the Repo rate makes borrowing cheaper for banks, who are then expected to pass on the benefit to their customers, stimulating borrowing and spending." },
            { question: "The 'Laffer Curve' illustrates the theoretical relationship between:", options: ["Inflation and unemployment.", "Tax rates and the amount of tax revenue collected by governments.", "Government spending and GDP growth.", "Interest rates and investment."], answer: 1, explanation: "The Laffer Curve suggests that as tax rates rise from zero, tax revenue increases up to a certain point. Beyond this point, further increases in tax rates discourage economic activity, leading to a fall in tax revenue." },
            { question: "What is 'Stagflation'?", options: ["A period of high economic growth and low inflation.", "A situation where the stock market is stagnant but the economy is growing.", "A period of high inflation combined with high unemployment and stagnant demand.", "A condition where the government's fiscal deficit remains unchanged for several years."], answer: 2, explanation: "Stagflation is a particularly difficult economic condition for policymakers because the tools used to fight inflation (e.g., raising interest rates) can worsen unemployment, and the tools used to fight unemployment (e.g., cutting interest rates) can worsen inflation." },
            { question: "The 'Money Multiplier' effect will be larger if:", options: ["The public decides to hold more cash instead of depositing it in banks.", "The Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) is increased.", "The public decides to hold less cash, and the CRR is low.", "The Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) is increased."], answer: 2, explanation: "The money multiplier is inversely related to the reserve ratio (CRR) and the currency-deposit ratio. A lower CRR and a lower preference for holding cash mean more of the deposited money can be lent out, multiplying the money supply." },
            { question: "The 'Law of Demand' states that, ceteris paribus (all other factors being equal):", options: ["As the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded increases.", "As the price of a good increases, the quantity demanded decreases.", "There is no relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.", "As income increases, the demand for all goods increases."], answer: 1, explanation: "This is the fundamental principle of demand. As a product becomes more expensive, consumers are typically willing and able to buy less of it." },
            { question: "If the RBI observes persistent high inflation (well above its tolerance band) coupled with sluggish GDP growth, and it decides to prioritize inflation control, what would be the most likely immediate consequence of its monetary policy actions on the banking sector?", options: ["A decrease in the Net Interest Margin (NIM) for banks due to a sharp rise in deposit rates but a slower repricing of existing loans.", "A sudden increase in demand for corporate credit as investment becomes cheaper.", "A reduction in banks' holdings of SLR securities as they are sold to fund credit growth.", "An expansion of banks' balance sheets due to an accommodative liquidity stance."], answer: 0, explanation: "When the RBI hikes the repo rate, banks raise their deposit rates to attract funds.
